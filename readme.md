Vehicle Registration Dashboard üöó
This project is an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit and Python to analyze vehicle registration data from an investor's perspective. It provides a clean, user-friendly interface to visualize key performance indicators, trends, and growth metrics.

üöÄ Setup Instructions
Follow these simple steps to set up and run the dashboard locally.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.

Installation
Clone this repository or download the project files.

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

pip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly python-dateutil

Running the App
Save the provided Python code as app.py.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where you saved app.py.

Run the following command to start the Streamlit server:

streamlit run app.py

The dashboard will automatically open in your default web browser.

üìä Data Assumptions
This dashboard is built on the assumption that the input data follows a specific structure. The mock data generation function in app.py is an example of this structure. To replace the mock data with your own, your dataset should have the following columns and data types:

registration_date: A date or datetime column (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).

vehicle_category: A string column representing vehicle types (e.g., '2W', '4W', 'Commercial').

manufacturer: A string column for the vehicle manufacturer (e.g., 'Toyota', 'Honda').

total_vehicles: An integer or float column for the number of vehicles registered.

You must ensure that your data is loaded and preprocessed to match this format for the dashboard to function correctly.

üó∫Ô∏è Feature Roadmap
This dashboard provides a solid foundation for vehicle registration analysis. Here are some potential features to add for future development:

Real-time Data Integration: Replace the mock data with a connection to a real data source, such as a SQL database or a web scraping script for the Vahan dashboard, to provide live updates.

Geographical Analysis: Incorporate geographical data and use a library like Folium or Plotly Express to visualize vehicle registrations on a map, broken down by state or city.

Predictive Analytics: Implement a forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA) to predict future registration trends, which can provide more strategic insights for investors.

Advanced Filtering: Add more granular filtering options, such as filtering by fuel type (petrol, diesel, electric) or vehicle model.

User Authentication: Add a login feature to restrict access to the dashboard and personalize the user experience.
